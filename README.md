# Let's DOMinate...
We need your helping making sure our super cool 
SEO February 2018 DOM appreciation website DOMinstrates how we can use 
javascript to interact with our HTML elements.

### So let's get to it....
Here's what we need: 
1. Clicking on the SEO logo should make the logo circular using the border-radius attribute
2. When your mouse is over the text, the textbox should have a border. When your mouse leaves, the border should disappear. 
3. Clicking on the button should change the title of the page to your very own DOM pun.
4. Hovering over the SEO should change it to a picture of an animal wearing a hat.
5. Clicking on the textbox should give it a text shadow. Clicking on it again should take away that text shadow (think back to our Taco Selector from yesterday!)

### Want more....
* Make the background image on the header change when you click on it
* Have the title text color change when your mouse is over the header area, if you really want to go crazy make it so only the "DOM" in the title changes.
* When you click on the image, make it move down and have a new image appear in its place.
* Make the background color change to a new random color everytime you click on the button (you may need to explore seting colors in RGB and random number generation)
* Have the title change to one of 5 different code-related puns when you click it (instead of just changing to one other one)
